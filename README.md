# tech-diversity-data

This dataset was created by Base10 Partners as part of The Advancement Initiative, a first-of-its-kind growth stage fund that donates 50% of profits directly to Historically Black Colleges & Universities in an effort to decrease the endowment gap between HBCUs and other comparable U.S. schools. On average, HBCUs have $15K in endowment per student, while their non-HBCU peers have $410K in endowment per student ([that data is available here](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-455.pdf)). 

As part of our early research for the Advancement Initiative, we looked into the technology industry's progress on diversity included compiling public tech company diversity figures from 2016 to present. The EEO-1 Component 1 report is a mandatory annual data collection that requires all private sector employers with 100 or more employees, and federal contractors with 50 or more employees meeting certain criteria, to submit demographic workforce data, including data by race/ethnicity, sex, and job categories.

In addition to EEO-1 reports, many tech companies opt to release their own versions of diversity reports. It is important to note that while many of these companies have made public statements around improving DEI hiring processes and setting internal DEI goals, not all companies that have reported diversity data in the past do so on a consistent annual basis:

Despite gaps, the dataset reveals a positive upward trends in terms of companies hiring more underrepresented minorities and women, particularly in technical and leadership roles. However, Silicon Valley still has a long way to go when it comes to workforce diversity and equality, and we plan on revisiting these companies' reports annually.
